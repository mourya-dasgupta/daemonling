# Build Log

One entry per milestone: what was built, key decisions, what was hard, test/coverage numbers, what
is deferred, and a Founder's comment.

## M0 — Foundations (2026-11-03)

**What was built.** A pnpm monorepo with three libraries (`packages/core`, `packages/store`,
`packages/sprites`) and three apps (`apps/cli`, `apps/vscode`, `apps/web`), each wired for
TypeScript strict typechecking, Vitest, and a production build. Root ESLint (flat config) and
Prettier, `.editorconfig`, `.nvmrc`, a GitHub Actions CI workflow (install → lint → format check →
typecheck → test with coverage gate → build → package the `.vsix` as an artifact), `PROGRESS.md`,
this log, the decision log, and skeletons for every founder document.

**Key decisions.** D-002 (a custom `daemonling-source` export condition so tests and bundles read
TypeScript sources directly), D-004 (esbuild bundles for the CLI and the extension), D-006 (coverage
gate scoped to the engine).

**What was hard.** Making one TypeScript setup serve three runtimes (Node CLI, VS Code's CommonJS
extension host, and a browser bundle) without project references. The export-condition trick keeps
it to one `tsconfig.base.json` plus small per-package overrides.

**Tests / coverage.** 6 smoke tests passing (one per package). Coverage is trivially 100% on the
empty core.

**Deferred.** Everything functional — this milestone only proves the pipes.

**Founder's comment.** We are a tiny company betting that a small, delightful tool can earn a place
in a developer's daily loop. That only works if we can ship every day without fear, so the very
first thing we built is the safety net: one command that lints, typechecks, tests and builds every
surface. It is boring work, and it is the reason the interesting work can move fast.
